# System dependencies:
# - libreoffice / libreoffice-writer / python3-uno / xvfb: docx -> pdf conversion
# - fonts-liberation: Arial / Times New Roman equivalents (Liberation Sans/Serif)
# - fonts-crosextra-carlito / fonts-crosextra-caladea: Calibri / Cambria
#   equivalents. Without these, LibreOffice silently substitutes DejaVu Sans
#   for any Calibri template (Word's modern default font) - DejaVu Sans is
#   NOT metric-compatible, so the generated PDF reflows differently (different
#   line breaks, page breaks) than the template looked in Word. Confirmed by
#   direct testing - this is a real, previously-fixed bug, not a guess.
# - gcc / libpq-dev: asyncpg ships prebuilt wheels for most platforms, but if
#   none matches this exact base image, pip falls back to compiling its C
#   extension from source, which fails outright without these.

# second worker process would never see jobs started on the first one.
# Shell form (not exec-array form) is required here too, specifically so
# ${PORT:-8000} actually gets expanded - the exec form doesn't invoke a
# shell and would pass the literal string "$PORT" through unexpanded.
