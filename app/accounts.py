"""
Password hashing and session tokens - deliberately the SAME scheme Vett
uses (bcrypt, HMAC-signed stateless session tokens), not just a similar
one. Both products verify credentials against the same `users` table, so
using an incompatible hash scheme here would mean a password set via Vett
couldn't be verified by Statement Generator, defeating the point of a
shared identity table.

Uses the `bcrypt` library directly rather than through passlib. Vett's own
hashing goes through passlib's bcrypt backend, but passlib produces
standard bcrypt hash strings ($2b$...) - the same universal format the
`bcrypt` library reads and writes directly, since bcrypt is a well-defined
algorithm/format, not something passlib invented. So hashes are still
fully cross-verifiable between the two products; what changed is just
which library computes them. This avoids a real, current passlib/bcrypt
version-compatibility bug (passlib is effectively unmaintained, and
bcrypt>=4.1 removed an attribute passlib's own version-detection code
depends on - confirmed by hitting exactly this failure directly).

The session token format and SESSION_SECRET_KEY env var name also match
Vett's exactly. Neither product's cookie currently sets an explicit
`domain=`, so a session isn't shared across subdomains yet - but because
the token format and signing secret are identical, turning that on later
(once both products sit under one parent domain) is a one-line change to
each set_cookie call, not a rearchitecture.
